# Translation Keys Expansion Summary

## Task Completed: Expand translation keys in messages/en.json

### Analysis Performed
I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the codebase to identify all hardcoded text strings across components and pages:

1. **Searched for hardcoded English text patterns** in JSX files
2. **Searched for hardcoded Korean text patterns** in JSX files  
3. **Analyzed key page components** (home, search, playlist, price, checkout)
4. **Analyzed UI components** (header, footer, navigation, search)
5. **Analyzed authentication and modal components**
6. **Analyzed player and payment components**

### New Translation Keys Added

#### Expanded Existing Namespaces:
- **company**: Added labels for CEO, business registration, telecom license, address, phone
- **ui**: Added terms, privacy, support, features, select_plan, per_month
- **auth**: Added username_email_placeholder, password_placeholder, invalid_credentials, terms_agreement
- **payment**: Added payment_methods (plural form)
- **modal**: Added works namespace
- **pricing**: Added unlock_unlimited_access, gain_instant_access, unlimited_downloads, music_distribution_channels, revision_services_per_month, normal_revision, advanced_revision, download_music, music_per_month

#### New Namespaces Created:
- **search**: placeholder, no_term_entered, other_suggestions, related_keywords
- **player**: now_standby, subtitle_placeholder (plus existing audio controls)
- **playlist**: page_title, page_content
- **forms**: input_reset_warning, terms_agreement, select_payment_method, tag_already_added
- **pages**: Organized by page sections (home, search, playlist, pricing, terms)
- **checkout**: Comprehensive checkout-specific translations

### Key Hardcoded Text Identified for Translation:

#### Page Content:
- "Explore Unlimited Background Music – Anytime, Anywhere!" → `pages.home.hero_title`
- "Unlock Unlimited Access to Our Music Library!" → `pages.pricing.hero_title`
- "Gain instant access to over 1 million tracks..." → `pages.pricing.hero_subtitle`
- "다른 검색어들이 나옴 (클릭가능)" → `pages.home.empty_suggestions`
- "No search term entered. Please enter a search term." → `pages.search.no_term_message`

#### UI Components:
- "Search" placeholder → `search.placeholder`
- "Now Stanby" → `player.now_standby`
- "Sub Title" → `player.subtitle_placeholder`
- "Select Plan" → `ui.select_plan`
- "Features" → `ui.features`
- "per month" → `ui.per_month`

#### Authentication:
- "Username or E-mail Address" → `auth.username_email_placeholder`
- "Password" → `auth.password_placeholder`
- "Invalid email or password" → `auth.invalid_credentials`
- "입력중인 정보가 초기화됩니다." → `forms.input_reset_warning`

#### Footer/Company Info:
- "이용약관" → `ui.terms`
- "개인정보처리방침" → `ui.privacy`
- "고객지원" → `ui.support`
- "서비스 정보" → `ui.service_info`
- Company labels for CEO, business registration, etc.

#### Checkout/Payment:
- Various payment method labels and descriptions
- Calculation labels (monthly price, discount, etc.)
- Payment guide text

### Translation Key Structure
The expanded translation file now follows the design document's namespace organization:

```
company.*          # Company information and labels
navigation.*       # Navigation menu items
ui.*              # Common UI elements and labels
search.*          # Search-related text
player.*          # Audio player related text
playlist.*        # Playlist page content
audio.*           # Audio controls (existing)
auth.*            # Authentication related text
payment.*         # Payment system text
pricing.*         # Pricing page content
modal.*           # Modal components
tailored.*        # Tailored service (existing)
forms.*           # Form-related text and validation
errors.*          # Error messages (existing)
time.*            # Time-related text (existing)
meta.*            # Metadata (existing)
pages.*           # Page-specific content organized by page
checkout.*        # Checkout-specific translations
```

### Requirements Satisfied:
✅ **1.1**: All hardcoded text strings identified and translation keys created
✅ **1.2**: UI text properly organized with useTranslations hook structure in mind
✅ **2.1**: Translation keys grouped by feature/component area
✅ **2.2**: Consistent naming convention followed
✅ **2.3**: Existing en.json structure maintained while expanding appropriately

### Next Steps:
The translation keys are now ready for implementation in components. The next tasks in the implementation plan can proceed with updating individual components to use these translation keys with the useTranslations hook.

### File Status:
- ✅ messages/en.json - Expanded with comprehensive translation keys
- ✅ JSON validation - File is properly formatted and valid
- ✅ Namespace organization - Follows design document structure
- ✅ Backward compatibility - Existing keys maintained
