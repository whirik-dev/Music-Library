# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 AuthProvider에서 클라이언트가 백엔드 API를 직접 호출하고 있어 보안상 취약점과 CORS 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 Next.js API 라우트를 통해 백엔드 API 호출을 프록시하고, 클라이언트에서는 Next.js API만 호출하도록 개선하는 기능을 구현합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to proxy backend API calls through Next.js API routes, so that I can improve security and handle CORS issues properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the client needs to verify session THEN the system SHALL provide a Next.js API route that proxies the backend auth/isLogged endpoint
2. WHEN the client requests user data THEN the system SHALL provide a single Next.js API route that aggregates all user-related data from multiple backend endpoints
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL handle authentication headers and pass them securely to the backend
4. WHEN backend API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive all user initialization data in a single API call, so that I can reduce the number of network requests and improve performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user session is verified THEN the system SHALL fetch and return user membership, credits, download points, download history, and favorite data in a single response
2. WHEN aggregating user data THEN the system SHALL make parallel requests to backend services to minimize response time
3. WHEN any individual backend service fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other services and return partial data with error indicators
4. WHEN all user data is collected THEN the system SHALL return it in a structured format that matches the current client expectations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized API error handling, so that I can monitor and debug issues more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request details and response status
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 401 status codes
3. WHEN backend services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return 503 status codes with retry information
4. WHEN invalid requests are made THEN the system SHALL return 400 status codes with validation error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with the existing AuthProvider, so that I can migrate gradually without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the new API routes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same response structure as the current direct backend calls
2. WHEN the AuthProvider is updated THEN the system SHALL continue to work with existing store methods and data structures
3. WHEN migrating API calls THEN the system SHALL ensure no breaking changes to the component interface
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove direct backend URL dependencies from the client code
