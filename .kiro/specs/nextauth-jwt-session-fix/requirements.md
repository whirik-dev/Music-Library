# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 NextAuth JWT 세션에서 `ssid`를 서버사이드 API 라우트에서 접근할 때 "Unauthorized - No valid session found" 에러가 발생하고 있습니다. JWT 토큰에는 `ssid`가 저장되어 있지만, `auth()` 함수로 세션을 가져올 때 `session.user.ssid`가 `undefined`로 나타나는 문제를 해결해야 합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want NextAuth JWT tokens to properly expose ssid in server-side API routes, so that backend authentication can work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the auth() function is called in API routes THEN the system SHALL return session.user.ssid with the correct value from JWT token
2. WHEN JWT token contains ssid THEN the system SHALL make it accessible through the session callback
3. WHEN API routes validate sessions THEN the system SHALL successfully extract ssid for backend authentication
4. WHEN session is accessed server-side THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing API route structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain security while ensuring proper session data flow, so that ssid remains protected but accessible to server-side code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JWT tokens are created THEN the system SHALL store ssid securely in the token payload
2. WHEN sessions are accessed client-side THEN the system SHALL NOT expose ssid to the browser
3. WHEN sessions are accessed server-side THEN the system SHALL provide access to ssid through auth() function
4. WHEN API routes need authentication THEN the system SHALL successfully validate and extract ssid from JWT tokens

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent session handling across all API routes, so that authentication works uniformly throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API route calls auth() THEN the system SHALL return consistent session structure with ssid
2. WHEN session validation fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 401 errors with clear messaging
3. WHEN JWT tokens are invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN debugging session issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless authentication experience, so that login state is maintained correctly across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are logged in THEN the system SHALL maintain their session state across page refreshes
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL automatically handle authentication without user intervention
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle logout gracefully
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users
