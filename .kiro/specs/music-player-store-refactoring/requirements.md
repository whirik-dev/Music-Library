# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on refactoring the existing music player store (`useMusicItemStore.js`) to address critical issues including memory leaks, error handling, state consistency, performance optimization, code structure improvements, and enhanced user experience. The refactoring will maintain existing functionality while significantly improving reliability, maintainability, and performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory Leak Prevention

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the music player to properly manage memory resources, so that the application doesn't suffer from memory leaks when users interact with multiple tracks or navigate between pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple music player instances are created THEN each instance SHALL manage its own animation frame ID without conflicts
2. WHEN a component unmounts THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up all timers and animation frames
3. WHEN switching between tracks THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of previous audio resources
4. WHEN the application is idle THEN no unnecessary background processes SHALL continue running

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when audio playback fails, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio file fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages to the user
2. WHEN a network error occurs THEN the system SHALL clean up partial state and reset to a safe state
3. WHEN file corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN audio loading is cancelled THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and state

### Requirement 3: State Consistency Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and predictable state management, so that the music player behaves reliably across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing playing files THEN the property name SHALL be consistent (playingFiles not playingfiles)
2. WHEN setting volume THEN the volume calculation SHALL be centralized and consistent
3. WHEN updating state THEN all related properties SHALL be updated atomically
4. WHEN state transitions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth audio playback without performance issues, so that I can enjoy uninterrupted music streaming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching for music metadata THEN the system SHALL cache and reuse search results instead of multiple find() calls
2. WHEN updating playback progress THEN the system SHALL use efficient state management without unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN managing animation frames THEN the system SHALL optimize update frequency for smooth performance
4. WHEN handling multiple rapid state changes THEN the system SHALL debounce updates appropriately

### Requirement 5: Code Structure Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want well-organized and maintainable code, so that future modifications and debugging are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing global variables THEN they SHALL be encapsulated within the store or proper modules
2. WHEN handling promises THEN cancellation logic SHALL be clearly separated and documented
3. WHEN using magic numbers THEN they SHALL be defined as named constants with clear meanings
4. WHEN organizing code THEN related functionality SHALL be grouped logically

### Requirement 6: API Compatibility Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer using the music store, I want all existing methods and properties to continue working exactly as before, so that no existing code breaks during the refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring the store THEN all existing public methods SHALL maintain their current signatures
2. WHEN updating internal implementation THEN the external API SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN adding new methods THEN they SHALL not conflict with existing method names
4. WHEN modifying state properties THEN existing property names and types SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 7: Code Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and maintainable JavaScript code, so that future modifications are easier while keeping the existing language choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN it SHALL remain in JavaScript without TypeScript migration
2. WHEN simplifying logic THEN the code SHALL be more concise and readable
3. WHEN organizing functions THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns for easier maintenance
4. WHEN adding comments THEN they SHALL explain complex logic without being verbose

### Requirement 8: User Experience Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive controls and helpful feedback, so that I can effectively control music playback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is loading THEN I SHALL be able to cancel the loading process
2. WHEN playback fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt audio quality accordingly
4. WHEN using playback controls THEN they SHALL respond immediately with visual feedback

### Requirement 9: Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient resource usage, so that the application performs well under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio files are loaded THEN unused audio instances SHALL be properly unloaded
2. WHEN switching tracks rapidly THEN the system SHALL prevent resource accumulation
3. WHEN the browser is backgrounded THEN non-essential processes SHALL be paused
4. WHEN memory pressure is detected THEN the system SHALL release non-critical resources
