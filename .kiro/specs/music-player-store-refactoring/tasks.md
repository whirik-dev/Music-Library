# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create internal management modules and constants
  - Extract magic numbers into named constants at the top of the file
  - Create internal helper functions for timer, promise, and resource management
  - Implement encapsulated state management to replace global variables
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4, 1.1_

- [x] 2. Fix state consistency issues and typos
  - Correct the 'playingfiles' typo to 'playingFiles' in the onend handler
  - Consolidate volume handling logic to use consistent calculation
  - Ensure all state updates maintain data integrity
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 3. Implement comprehensive resource cleanup
  - Create centralized cleanup function that handles all resource disposal
  - Add proper cleanup in all error scenarios and state transitions
  - Implement automatic timer cleanup on component unmount
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 8.1, 8.2_

- [x] 4. Enhance error handling with proper cleanup
  - Improve onloaderror handler to include state cleanup and user feedback
  - Add comprehensive error categorization for different failure types
  - Implement proper error state management with automatic recovery
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Optimize performance with caching and efficient queries
  - Cache musicList.find() results to avoid duplicate queries in play method
  - Optimize animation frame updates with better state management
  - Implement efficient state update batching to reduce re-renders
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 6. Improve promise cancellation and async handling
  - Enhance promise cancellation logic with better separation of concerns
  - Add proper cleanup for cancelled promises and their associated resources
  - Implement more robust async error handling throughout the store
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 2.4, 1.3_

- [x] 7. Add user experience enhancements
  - Implement loading cancellation functionality for better user control
  - Add automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for failed loads
  - Improve immediate feedback for user interactions with playback controls
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [x] 8. Refactor code structure for maintainability
  - Organize related functionality into logical groups within the store
  - Simplify complex functions by breaking them into smaller, focused functions
  - Add clear comments for complex logic while keeping code concise
  - _Requirements: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive testing and validation
  - Write unit tests for all new helper functions and error scenarios
  - Create integration tests for the complete audio playback flow
  - Implement memory leak detection tests for resource management
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 8.3, 8.4_

- [x] 10. Final integration and performance verification
  - Integrate all improvements while maintaining API compatibility
  - Verify all existing functionality works exactly as before
  - Conduct performance benchmarking to measure improvements
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 4.4_
