# Requirements Document

## Introduction

이 프로젝트는 기존 React/Next.js 음악 스트리밍 플랫폼에 next-intl을 사용한 국제화(i18n) 기능을 구현하는 것입니다. 현재 프로젝트에는 이미 일부 next-intl 설정이 되어있지만, 모든 컴포넌트와 페이지의 하드코딩된 텍스트를 국제화 키로 대체하고 완전한 다국어 지원을 구현해야 합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement complete next-intl internationalization across all components and pages, so that the application can support multiple languages efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all hardcoded text strings SHALL be replaced with next-intl translation keys
2. WHEN a user visits any page THEN all UI text SHALL be properly internationalized using useTranslations hook
3. WHEN examining the codebase THEN no hardcoded Korean or English text SHALL remain in JSX components
4. WHEN the translation system is implemented THEN it SHALL use the existing messages/en.json structure and expand it appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to organize translation keys in a logical hierarchy, so that the translation files are maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing translation keys THEN they SHALL be grouped by feature/component area (navigation, auth, payment, etc.)
2. WHEN adding new translation keys THEN they SHALL follow a consistent naming convention
3. WHEN the en.json file is updated THEN it SHALL maintain the existing structure while adding new keys
4. WHEN translation keys are used THEN they SHALL be semantically meaningful and descriptive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all React components to use next-intl hooks, so that dynamic text content is properly internationalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating components THEN the useTranslations hook SHALL be imported and used correctly
2. WHEN replacing hardcoded text THEN the original meaning and context SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN components use dynamic text THEN they SHALL use appropriate translation parameters for interpolation
4. WHEN updating components THEN existing functionality SHALL not be broken

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper next-intl configuration, so that the internationalization system works correctly across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN next-intl SHALL be properly configured in the root layout
2. WHEN components use translations THEN they SHALL have access to the translation context
3. WHEN the HTMLProvider is updated THEN it SHALL support the internationalization system
4. WHEN the configuration is complete THEN it SHALL be compatible with the existing project structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to handle special cases like navigation menus and dynamic content, so that all user-facing text is internationalized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating navigation components THEN menu items SHALL use translation keys from the navigation namespace
2. WHEN handling form labels and placeholders THEN they SHALL be internationalized appropriately
3. WHEN dealing with error messages and notifications THEN they SHALL use the errors namespace
4. WHEN updating modal and popup content THEN all text SHALL be properly internationalized

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain code quality and consistency, so that the internationalization implementation follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing translations THEN the code SHALL maintain existing component structure and styling
2. WHEN adding translation keys THEN they SHALL not duplicate existing keys in en.json
3. WHEN updating components THEN import statements SHALL be organized and clean
4. WHEN the implementation is complete THEN no unused translation keys SHALL remain in the JSON file
